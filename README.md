# Semester Project 4
A pan-tilt manual monitoring system for a camera, with the usage of an exsiting pan-tilt system. Movement from TIVA Master Board and processing on the FPGA Pynq Z2 Slave Board as shown, the connection between the two boards was obtaing by using an SPI protocol.
I was mainly responsible for the programming in VHDL of the FPGA Slave board and helped with C code for the TIVA Master Board. The communication and process is described as follows in the picture below.
